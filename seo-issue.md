This website is not using a custom 404 error page! Default 404 error pages result in a poor experience - it can mislead users into thinking an entire site is down or broken, greatly increases the chance they leave the website entirely, and looks unprofessional. We recommend to have a custom 404 error page in order to improve the website's user experience by letting users know that only a specific page is missing/broken (and not the entire site), providing them helpful links, the opportunity to report bugs, and potentially track the source of broken links.

This webpage is using the canonical link tag. This tag specifies that the URL: https://leegoscaffolding.com/en should be the preferred version of this page. The canonical tag can be useful when there are similar versions of the same content on several URLs (e.g., such as e-commerce sites where URL modifiers like sort parameters are appended to a product page's URL). Please ensure that this specification is correct, as canonical tags are often hard-coded and may not always reflect the latest changes in a site's URL structure.

This DNS server is not using an SPF record! SPF (Sender Policy Framework) allows administrators to specify which hosts are allowed to send mail from a given domain by creating a specific SPF record or TXT record in the Domain Name System (DNS). You can find more information about SPF records here.
